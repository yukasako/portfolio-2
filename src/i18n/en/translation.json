    "h2": "Hi I'm Yuka. \n A Junior Frontend Developer",
    "p": "Junior front-end developer, recently graduated from Nackademin, a higher vocational education institution in Sweden. While studying, I worked as a front-end developer intern at Triggerbee, contributing to UI/UX development and user-facing features. \n \n Previous experience in web marketing, international logistics, customer service and store management. Originally from Tokyo and moved to Stockholm in 2016. After completing all the Swedish courses, I worked in E-commerce marketing for the Japanese market. \n \n I also created an Instagram comic project about life in Sweden, @yukainsweden, which reached around 20,000 followers at its peak. Frontend development and comic creation are very similar to me. Both involve visualising ideas by considering the perspectives of users or readers. Both require concentration, persistence and patience, and it brings great joy of creating. Skaparglädje is my key word, and I aspire to make such work my livelihood."
